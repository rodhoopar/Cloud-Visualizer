# cloud-visualizer

This tool allows you to visualize a folder and all of its children in one of your cloud services as a graph. For example: 

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.github.com/rodhoopar/cloud-visualizer/master/examples/demo.png"/>
</p>

Try it out yourself [here](https://rodhoopar.github.io/cloud-visualizer). 

Full capabilities include: 
* Vertex coloring based on what it represents 
* Vertex sizing based on size of file it represents
* Additional information (name, size, modified, edges to children and parent) on hover
* Graph modification on vertex drag, including toggleable "stickiness" 
* Search with autocomplete suggestions

Built using Kloudless, d3.js, and jQuery. More clouds to be added.
